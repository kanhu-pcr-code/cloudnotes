 This includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures.[14] The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:
<ul>
    <li>Development and implementation of computer programs that enable efficient access to, use and management of, various types of information.     </li>
    <li> Development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistical measures that assess relationships among members of large data sets. For example, there are methods to locate a gene within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.     </li>
